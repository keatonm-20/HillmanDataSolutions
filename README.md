# Hillman Data Solutions

## Project Background
Hillman Data Solutions is a data collection company that collaborates with hospitals and clinics to gather critical healthcare information, including admission and discharge dates, patient demographics, medications, and medical conditions. The company specializes in tracking conditions such as obesity, diabetes, arthritis, and cancer, among others. As part of a team of data analysts, I am working to extract meaningful insights from this data to help healthcare providers identify key patterns and make informed decisions.

## Executive Summary
This dataset analysis provides key insights into patient demographics, prevalent medical conditions, hospital admission trends, and billing patterns. The dataset comprises 54,966 patient records, offering a comprehensive view of healthcare utilization. The gender distribution is nearly equal, with 27,496 male and 27,470 female patients. The average patient age is 51.5 years, spanning a wide range from 13 to 89 years, highlighting the diverse age groups seeking medical care. These insights help identify trends in patient demographics and healthcare needs, supporting data-driven decision-making for improved medical services and resource allocation.

## Key Features
### Trend Analysis:
Identified which doctors have the highest patient volume, uncovering patterns in patient distribution.
### Admission vs Discharge Patterns:
Analyzed yearly trends in hospital admissions compared to discharge counts to assess patient flow.
### Monthly Patient Volume:
Conducted a breakdown of patient count by month to identify seasonal variations or operational bottlenecks.
### Billing Insights:
Calculated the median billing amount per quarter to detect financial trends and potential abnormalities in healthcare costs.

### Tools Used:
- Excel & Python for data cleaning
- Power BI for data visualization
